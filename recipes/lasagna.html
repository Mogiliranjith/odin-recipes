  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of wide, 
    flat pasta (also called lasagna noodles) with various fillings such as ragú (meat sauce), 
    béchamel, vegetables, and different cheeses, then baked in an ovenproof dish.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong> About 9 to 15 noodles, which can be regular (boiled first) or oven-ready/no-boil.</li>
    <li><strong>Ground Meat:</strong> A mix of lean ground beef and Italian sausage is common for the best flavor, typically 1 to 2 pounds total.</li>
    <li><strong> Sauce:</strong> A combination of canned crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, or a high-quality store-bought marinara sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese (or cottage cheese as a substitute) for the creamy layer.</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese (shredded or sliced) for its melting quality.</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese (freshly grated is best) for a sharp, salty flavor.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Aromatics & Seasonings:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Olive oil.</li>
        <li>Dried herbs like basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Salt, black pepper, and sometimes a pinch of sugar or nutmeg to balance acidity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Binder:</strong> Eggs are typically mixed into the ricotta layer to help it set and prevent it from becoming runny.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation Phase:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil lasagna noodles in salted water according to the package directions until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain them and lay them flat on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking, or use oven-ready/no-boil noodles to skip this step.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the meat sauce:</strong> In a large skillet or pot, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage with chopped onions and minced garlic. Drain excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and seasonings, then simmer for about 20-30 minutes for the flavors to meld.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the cheese mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, a beaten egg, Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley. Mix until well blended. </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
