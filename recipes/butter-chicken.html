  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is a classic Indian curry dish consisting of marinated, grilled chicken pieces simmered in a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato and butter-based gravy. Originating in Delhi, India, in the 1950s, it has become a globally popular dish.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>For the Chicken Marinade</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><string>Plain yogurt</string> (preferably Greek or hung curd)</li>
    <li><string>Ginger-garlic paste</string> (or finely minced ginger and garlic)</li>
    <li><string>Spices:</string> Garam masala, Kashmiri red chili powder (for color and mild heat), turmeric powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder</li>
    <li><string>Lemon juice and salt</string></li>
    <li><string>Oil</string></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For the Butter Chicken Sauce (Gravy)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Butter (a generous amount, as the name suggests) and oil or ghee</li>
    <li>Aromatics: Onions, ginger, and garlic</li>
    <li>Tomatoes: Crushed tomatoes, passata, or a high-quality tomato paste form the base</li>
    <li>Spices: Garam masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder</li>
    <li>Cashew nuts: Often blended into the sauce to add thickness and a delicate, nutty creaminess</li>
    <li>Heavy or fresh cream: Stirred in at the end for richness and a luscious finish</li>
    <li>Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves): A crucial "magic ingredient" that provides the dish's distinctive flavor</li>
    <li>Sugar or honey and salt: To balance the flavors (the sweetness from the tomatoes and the tang from the spices)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Marinate the Chicken: Combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and all dry spices (garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, cumin, salt) in a bowl. Add the chicken pieces and mix well. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally several hours/overnight.</li>
    <li>Sear the Chicken: Heat butter or oil in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the marinated chicken pieces in batches until browned and slightly charred on the edges, then remove them and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Sauce Base: In the same pot, add more butter/ghee if needed. Sauté chopped onions until softened, then add ginger-garlic paste and cook until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Simmer the Gravy: Add the ground spices to the pot and cook for about a minute. Pour in the tomato puree/crushed tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10-20 minutes until it thickens and the oil begins to separate from the tomato mixture.</li>
    <li>Blend the Sauce (Optional but Recommended): Let the sauce cool slightly, then transfer to a blender and blend until perfectly smooth. (Soaked cashews can be added now for extra richness). Return the smooth sauce to the pot.</li>
    <li>Combine and Finish: Stir the heavy cream and crushed kasuri methi into the smooth gravy. Season with salt and a pinch of sugar to balance the flavors. Add the reserved seared chicken pieces back into the sauce.</li>
    <li>Simmer and Serve: Simmer the combined dish on low heat for an additional 5-10 minutes, ensuring the chicken is fully cooked through and tender. Garnish with fresh cilantro and an optional final swirl of cream or butter.</li>
  </ol>
