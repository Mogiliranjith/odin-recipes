  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Steak refers to a high-quality slice of meat, typically beef, cut across the muscle fibers and generally cooked quickly over high heat. It is prized for its flavor and tenderness and is a staple in many cuisines worldwide.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Steak: A cut of beef like a ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon.</li>
    <li>Coarse salt: Kosher or sea salt is often preferred for creating a good crust.</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper: For seasoning.</li>
    <li>Cooking oil: A neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point, like vegetable or canola oil, for searing.</li>
    <li>Butter: Often used for basting the steak towards the end of cooking for added richness.</li>
    <li>Aromatics (optional): Garlic cloves, fresh rosemary, or thyme sprigs can be added to the basting butter for extra flavor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring to Room Temperature: Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes to an hour before cooking. This ensures the steak cooks evenly throughout.</li>
    <li>Pat Dry and Season: Use paper towels to thoroughly pat the surface of the steak dry; this is essential for a good sear and crust. Season both sides and the edges generously with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper right before placing it in the pan.</li>
    <li>Heat the Pan: Place a heavy-bottomed skillet (cast iron works best) over high heat. Let the pan get very hot, about 5-10 minutes, until it just begins to smoke lightly.</li>
    <li>Add Oil and Sear: Add a tablespoon or two of a high smoke point oil (like vegetable or canola oil) to the hot pan and swirl to coat. Carefully place the steak in the pan, laying it away from you to avoid splashes.</li>
    <li>Cook Undisturbed (Flip Once): Let the steak sear without moving it for 2 to 4 minutes on the first side to develop a deep brown crust. Use tongs to flip it over, then cook the second side for another 2 to 4 minutes. The exact time depends on the thickness of the steak and your desired doneness.</li>
    <li>Baste with Butter and Aromatics (Optional): In the last minute or two of cooking, reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons of butter, smashed garlic cloves, and sprigs of fresh rosemary or thyme to the pan. Tilt the pan to pool the butter mixture and use a large spoon to continuously baste the steak with the melted, infused butter.</li>
    <li>Check Doneness: Use an instant-read meat thermometer to check the internal temperature by inserting it into the thickest part of the steak. For a medium-rare steak, aim for a temperature of around 125°F to 130°F (52°C–54°C).</li>
    <li>Rest the Steak: Remove the steak from the pan and place it on a cutting board or a warm plate. Tent it loosely with aluminum foil and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes (longer for thicker cuts). This crucial step allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring it remains moist and tender when sliced.</li>
    <li>Slice and Serve: Slice the steak against the grain into desired portions and serve immediately, optionally drizzling any remaining pan juices over the slices. </li>
  </ol>
